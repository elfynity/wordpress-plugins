Create a mini directory on any post or page with a filtering search function in a sidebar. Filters 2 top level categories of your choise and tags. Responsive on mobile.

== Description ==
Creates a search page where you can use a search filter to go over a  selection of your posts to search by multiple categories and tags. 

* You should have 2 parent categories with sub categories in both. 
* You should also set up some post tags. This will help you to really make full use of the plugin. 
* In your Wordpress dashboard, go into Settings -> Cyba Advanced Search to choose your options. Use the shortcode: [cyba-advanced-search] on any page to show the plugin in action.

I definitely plan to develop this plugin further. 

== Installation ==
1. Install the plugin and click Activate. 
2. Set up 2 parent categories with a couple of sub categories in each and assign posts to them. 
3. In your Wordpress dashboard navigate to Settings -> Cyba Advanced Search and choose your categories and the amount of posts results you want to display per page. 
4. Copy this shortcode [cyba-advanced-search] and paste it into a page where you would like to view the search magic happen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will this plugin be updated in future? =
Yes. This is a work in progress.

= Why is this plugin so simple? =
It is the first draft of a plugin idea that is actually being successfully used on a website I developed. I thought, hey, instead of building the functionality into the Wordpress theme, I should create a plugin that can be used over and over.





== Screenshots ==
1. In the left sidebar, navigate to Settings -> Cyba Advanced Search to choose your two parent categories for the search and decide on how many posts you'd like to display per page.
2. Then, in a post or a page, paste the shortcode [cyba-advanced search] and Publish.
